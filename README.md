# React-Employee-Directory

## Overview

Using React and the Random User API, you will create an employee directory. This directory will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. In this directory you will be able to view your entire list of employees while also searching by an employee just by typing a first or last name.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
